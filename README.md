Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning and NLP
I successfully developed and deployed a Sentiment Analysis Web Application using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. The project involved data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and deployment in a user-friendly interface using Streamlit.

Key highlights:
Data Processing: Cleaned and preprocessed IMDB review dataset using techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
Feature Engineering: Implemented TF-IDF Vectorization to transform text into numerical features.
Model Training: Built a deep learning model using Keras & TensorFlow, leveraging Dense Neural Networks for sentiment classification.
Model Deployment: Integrated the trained model into a Streamlit-based web app for real-time sentiment prediction.
Performance Optimization: Fine-tuned the model to enhance accuracy and ensured efficient prediction using joblib serialization for quick inference.

This project demonstrates my expertise in AI, NLP, and machine learning model deployment, showcasing my ability to build end-to-end data-driven solutions.
